ExtIO for Hermes receiver.
==========================

Andrea Montefusco IW0HDV


1. Installation
---------------

In order to use this DLL you have to install, as prerequisite, the runtime 
for Microsoft Visual C++ 2010.
Please select the proper release (32 or 64 bit), seconding your 
Windows system requirement.

Next the two shared libraries (.dll extension files provided in this packet) have 
to be copied in the same directory where the Studio1 executable lives.

In Debug directory you find another shared library, that, though, can be 
used only if you have the real compiler installed in your machine (it seems 
that Microsoft explicitly forbids to run an executable with debug info
in a machine where the compiler is not installed [1]).


2. First run
------------

Start Studio1, if the only ExtIO is the Hermes one, it is automatically selected.
Next the search for the radio hardware is started: if any hardware is found 
the MAC and IP address are shown in the upper text box.
So, press Start and the receivers is activated.


3. How to run multiple instances of Studio 1
--------------------------------------------

In order to exploit the multi receiver capabilities of Hermes receiver, 
start the first instance: after that select the maximum number of receiver
you want to use (drop box).
In order to activate further receivers, start more instances of Studio1 
and setup them as you prefer.
If the an instance, after the first, is not started, stop all the Studio1 instances and 
delete the Studio1 registry offending instance with the following command:

   reg DELETE HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\SDR_Applications\Studio1\1.0\AppInst_2

in the above example, the instance delete is the third.


4. How to use the Hermes transmitter
------------------------------------

At the moment it is not feasible to use the Hermes transmitter with this DLL.
